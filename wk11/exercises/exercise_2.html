      // tasks:
      // 1. when the mouse is clicked, add a new ellipse at that point. Things to think about:
      // 1a. how to get the current mouse position
      // 1b. how to keep track of multiple ellipses
      // 1c. how to draw multiple ellipses

      // 2 make each ellipse have a different color, size or speed
      // 3 (if time allows) make the faster circles have a colder color and the slower a warmer one
      // 4 (if time allows) make the shapes alternate between ellipse and rectangle when SPACE is pushed

      // note: if you're used to this kind of thing, you might want to create a Class for these ellipses
      // if so, great, give it a go. But it would involve a bit too much explanation to get into in class
