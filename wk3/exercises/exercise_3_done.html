    // 1. Just run this to check that the above approach isn't working. What is the trial displaying?
      // It says "Why did you say undefined?" so something isn't working...
      // It's because on loading, the entire script is run.
      // At the time of loading, gettier_response is declared with var, but isn't given a value
      // So at the time the script is run, this is undefined
      // As the script proceeds then to justification_trial, it uses the currently undefined
      // value of gettier_response when initialising the question prompt
      // hence "Why did you say undefined?"
    // 2. To have it check the value of gettier_response at the current time (rather than on load),
    //    wrap the relevant value in a function:
    //    so instead of key: value,
    //    put key: function(){return value},
