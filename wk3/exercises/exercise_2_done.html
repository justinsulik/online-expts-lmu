    // 1. Review the notes on js Objects to work out how to extract the response from the trial data
        // you can use either object['key'] or object.key to get the response
    // 2. How useful is this response? What does it mean? Can you make it more informative?
        // Added a console.log to see what it is
        // It looks to be a number - it's just the index of the option in options_shuffled
        // To make the response more informative, we can just use this index on options_shuffled
        // hence options_shuffled[response]
    // 3. Store it as a variable called 'gettier_response'
    // 4. One choice: where to declare that variable?
        // The key thing to remember is: if you declare a variable with var inside a function,
        // it is only visible inside that function (here: the on_finish function)
        // But we want this response to be visible outside of this context
        // so I've defined it with var getter_response in the main part of the experiment script
