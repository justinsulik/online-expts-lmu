# Online experiments course

For each week's material (lecture slides, examples and homework), see the relevant `wk#` folder.

These folders will be updated the morning of each class with that week's materials. 

The summary of the weekly topics, readings and course assignments, as well as the zoom link, are in the syllabus that was mailed to you.
