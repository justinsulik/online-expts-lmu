## Philosophy of science and science of philosophy

- We were going to talk about things that X-Phi can do that go beyond collecting intuitions to solve questions like "What is knowledge?"

- However, I'm going to move this forward, distributing it between week 9 ("Going beyond intuitions") and week 13 ("Science")

# Git and Github

## Git + Github

- Git: a local version control system
- Github: a way to make Git collaborative

- But, it's easier to start with *why* we need it before we worry about *just* what it does, so let's start at the end

## Git + Github

- Let's say you've written an experiment script
- It's on your local machine
- BUT for participants to actually do your study, it needs to be hosted somewhere online
  - somewhere it can have a distinctive web address
- You need to upload it, but it's not just a single file! There are lots of libraries and plugins!
- Git can take a "snapshot" of the latest working version, and "push" your project (not only individual files but the whole project) to some cloud storage

&rarr; If you want to send code somewhere (especially where a machine, like a server, can access it), use Git

## Git + Github

- Ok, let's say you have a survey that you've started working on
- Let's say you want to make a change (or a series of changes):

```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  version4 -> version3 -> version2 -> version1
  }
  ", 
  height = 50)
```

- So far, this is a bit like undo/redo on Word, except:
- It's not for tracking every single change or every time you press a key
  - You decide when each job or step or phase is done. Then you take a snapshot and give it a label
  - a bit like having multiple copies of a document (one for each version, except it magically needs just one file)
  
## Git + Github

## Git + Github

- The advantage? If you make a mistake/want to go back to an earlier version, you can just say "go back to v2"


```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  v1
  v2
  v3
  v4
  
  node [shape = oval]
  head [label='I AM HERE NOW']
  
  v4 -> v3 -> v2 -> v1
  head -> v2
  }
  ", 
  height = 100)
```


## Git + Github

- Or if you change your mind and want to carry on where you stopped, you can just say "go back to v4"
- Simultaneously you can tell the online server to display the study at v3 

```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  v1
  v2
  v3
  v4
  
  node [shape = oval]
  head [label='I AM HERE NOW']
  server [label='Server display this']
  
  v4 -> v3 -> v2 -> v1
  head -> v4
  server -> v3
  }
  ", 
  height = 100)
```



&rarr; It's a bit like a time machine. But one that only visits major landmarks in time (and you decide when to take a snapshot)

## Git + Github

- So far it's just linear: leaping backward and forward
- But a great benefit of Git is that it can also *branch*
- You and a colleague are both working on a survey, starting from the same snapshot [v1]
  - You add some instruction; your collaborator adds some survey questions

```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  v1
  v2
  v3

  {v2 v3} -> v1
  }
  ", 
  height = 100)
```
  

## Git + Github  
  
- If it was a simple Word doc you could just copy/paste some changes
- But if it's in several places in each of several files, this is a pain
- Git can merge these for you!

```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  {v2 v3} -> v1
  v4 -> {v2 v3}
   
  }
  ", 
  height = 100)
```

  
&rarr; It's a bit like a time machine that can visit parallel timelines. And merge them together

## Git + Github

- It's especially useful when things get complicated

```{r, echo=F}
grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = RL]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = rectangle]
  {v2 v3} -> v1
  v4 -> {v2 v3}
  v5 -> v4
  {v6 v7 v8} -> v5
  v10 -> v9 -> v6
  v11 -> {v10 v8}

  }
  ", 
  height = 200)
```

## Git + Github

- Git handles this version control (time machine jumping between snapshots including parallel timelines)
- One place you can push a Git repostiory is Github, which makes it collaborative
- Another place is Heroku, which will host the webpage for you

## Git + Github

- But wait, why are we doing this?
- Ultimately, if you want to put code for a survey online you'll need it
- If you want to submit code for assessment you'll need it

## Git + Github

We're going to run through 7 git commands. There are obviously more, and this doesn't include  branching and merging etc.

```
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m"put an informative message here"
git remote
git pull [where] [what]
git push [where] [what]
```

Open exercise 1 and start using the commands there as we discuss them on the following slides

## Create a git repository

- `git init`
- tell git that you're going to want to start tracking files
- use whenever you're starting a new project (like next week's homework)
- ultimately, you'll be telling git which files to keep track of (or all)

## See what the status is

- `git status`
- tells you which branch you're on
- tells you if any changes have been made (to what files) 
- tells you if there are any files that you have added but haven't told git to keep track of

## Take a snapshot

- Git doesn't assume you're tracking all files. You need to tell it which to track, e.g.
- `git add myfile.txt`
- But if you do want to track everything, then you use a dot `.` to mean everything
- `git add .`
- Once you've told git which files to track (like a wedding photographer saying "Ok, this one is the bride's family so mom and dad, get in there")
- Then you have to take a snapshot. And use a nice informative message `-m` to describe it. 
- `git commit -m"picture of the bride's family"`
- `git commit -m"have added the multiple-choice task`"

## Connect to a remote/cloud storage repo

- `git remote add [handy label] [url]`
- `git remote add class_notes https://github.com/justinsulik/online-expts-lmu`

- Commonly you'll just see the remote lablelled `origin` which is rather uninformative


## Send/get 

To bring the latest files to your computer:

- `git pull [repo name] [which branch]`
- `git pull class_notes main`

To send newer versions to the cloud:

- `git push [repo name] [which branch]`

(There is also `git clone` if you want to just copy the whole thing, but not have your new project folder linked to the origin. Useful if you're just copying a template, for example)

## Homework

- Watch a couple videos at [https://git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc) or
- Find a tutorial that matches your learning style or
- Play the game at [https://ohmygit.org](https://ohmygit.org)
- We've been updating the class notes manually. Now, choose a directory you're going to stick with, initialise an empty git repostitory, add my github repo as a remote, and pull the files. Do that before each class.
