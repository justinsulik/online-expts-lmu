# Overview

- Introductions
- Course overview
- What is X-Phi?
- HTML + CSS + JS

## Course overview

- This is primarily a methods course
  - how to design + code an experiment to run online

- But it's also a philosophy course
  - how to poke at a theory by gathering data
  
- It's up to you how much of a theorist or coder you want to be

## Practical advice

- This is an online course
- We're learning about coding online experiments
- Embrace being online: learn with youtube, twitter, games

# What is X-Phi?

## What is X-Phi?

#### "Experimental philosophy is a new interdisciplinary field that uses **methods** normally associated with psychology to investigate **questions** normally associated with philosophy." 

- Knobe et al. (2012). *Annu. Rev. Psychol*, 63

## What is X-Phi?

#### "It used to be a commonplace that the discipline of philosophy was deeply concerned with questions about the human condition. Philosophers thought about human beings and how their minds worked. They took an interest in reason and passion, culture and innate ideas, the origins of people’s moral and religious beliefs. On this traditional conception, it wasn't particularly important to keep philosophy clearly distinct from psychology, history, or political science. Philosophers were concerned, in a very general way, with questions about how everything fit together."

- Knobe, 2008

## What is X-Phi?

#### "Perhaps the novelty is rather that experimental philosophers do not so much borrow from the scientists as that they become scientists."

- Sosa (2007). *Philos. Stud.*, 132

## What is X-Phi?

- I am *not* going to be keeping a hard boundary between X-Phi and other cognitive sciences

- We're casting a fairly broad net
  - If something seems not directly relevant, I am inviting you to find a bridge or see if you can have a shift in perspective.

- We're going to be getting meta
  - science about doing philosophy; philosophy about doing science

## How philosophy often works

*Philosophical question:* What is knowledge?

*Philosophical theory:* Knowledge is a justified true belief (JTB).

*Probe with a case:* 

- Smith & Jones have applied for a specific job. 

- Smith's boss has told him that Jones will get the job. Smith has counted the coins in Jones's pocket: there are 10 coins. 

- Smith believes that Jones will get the job & Jones has 10 coins in his pocket (and is justified in believing so).
- Thus, Smith believes that a man with 10 coins in his pocket will get the job.

- It turns out that Smith gets the job and has 10 coints in his pocket, so his belief was true.
- Do we want to say that Smith knew that a man with 10 coins would get the job?

*Intuition:* No. So is something wrong with JTB?

## How philosophy often works

*Philosophical question:* What determines whether an action is moral?

*Philosophical theory:* It is moral if it maximises utility (utilitarianism).

*Probe with a case:* 

- There is a mob rioting (due to unsolved murders), doing lots of damage and likely to cause deaths. 

- A magistrate knows that executing an innocent homeless man for the crime will appease them. 

- This will stop them rioting and overall do the least harm. Should he do it?

*Intuition:* No. So is something wrong with utilitarianism?

## How philosophy often works

Traditionally, a philosopher's intuition serves as evidence

(Though, like everything, this is subject to debate)

(And X-Phi turns out to be one of the reasons it's up for debate)

## Issue 1: People don't share the intuition

Effect of gender:

- Peter is in his locked apartment, and is reading. He decides to have a shower. He puts his **book** down on the coffee table. Then he takes off his watch, and also puts it on the coffee table. Then he goes into the bathroom. As Peter’s shower begins, a burglar silently breaks into Peter’s apartment. The burglar takes Peter’s watch, puts a cheap plastic watch in its place, and then leaves. Peter has only been in the shower for two minutes, and he did not hear anything.

- Does Peter really know there is a **book** on the table or does he only believe it?

- Starmans & Friedman (2009); Buckwalter & Stich (2014)

## Issue 2: Intuitions depend on something (not predicted by theory)

Theory: intentionality influences moral judgments

But it turns out moral judgments influence intentionality (The side-effect effect)

The vice president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, and it will also **help** the environment." The chairman of the board answered, "I don’t care at all about **helping** the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let's start the new program." They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was **helped**. Did the chairman *intentionally* **help** the environment?

- Knobe (2003)

But it turns out moral judgments influence intentionality (The side-effect effect)

The vice president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, and it will also **harm** the environment." The chairman of the board answered, "I don’t care at all about **harming** the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let's start the new program." They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was **harmed**. Did the chairman *intentionally* **harm** the environment?

- Knobe (2003)

## Why do X-Phi?

- These issues are complex. 
- Let's stop pretending everyone will have same intuitions (&#x2192;diversity) or that we know what matters (&#x2192;sensitivity)
- If intuition = evidence, just getting more (better?) evidence!

- Whose intuitions? See week 2.
- What are intuitions? Or theory for that matter? See week 3. 
- Beyond intuitions? See week 6

## What are its aims? Why collect empirical evidence? 

- Negative: Having a (mostly white, western male) philosopher sitting in an armchair pondering his intuitions is a bad way to do things...
- Positive: By gathering evidence, we are doing a better job of building theory (or conceptual analysis or whatever...)
- Stich & Tobia (2016)

## What are its aims? Why collect empirical evidence? 

- determine which intuitions are universally shared and which vary according to culture and other demographic differences; 
- investigate what leads us to have the intuitions we do and whether or not the psychological sources undercut warrant; 
- study patterns in people’s intuitions to gain insight into how people think. &#x2192;explanatory depth (but starting to sound more like cognitive science...)
- Knobe & Nichols (2008); Knobe (2016)

## What are its aims? Why collect empirical evidence?

- More on explantory depth:
  - When an act is described more concretely, people think it is morally worse than when described more abstractly
  - &#x2192; People's moral intuitions are (partly) due to affect (=emotion)
  - &#x2192; People’s moral intuitions are shaped by the interaction of two different systems: one relying on abstract theory and one relying on immediate affective reactions
- Knobe & Nichols (2008)

## What are its aims? Why collect empirical evidence?

- Narrower: Getting a *bunch* of intuitions to do the usual kinds of things philosophers do with inuitions
- Broader: Using empirical methods to throw light on philosophical issues

  - Not only intuitions
  - Not only philosophers have philosophical issues
  - Again, sounding a bit more like cognitive science

# So you want to collect data.<br>How to do that online?

# HTML + CSS + JS: the languages of the web

## Out-of-the-box solutions

You may have heard of things like Google forms, Survey monkey, Qualtrics, Gorilla...

- The free stuff is *very* limited
- The good stuff isn't free
  - Even then, it's still quite limited
- By coding your own experiments:
  - You have complete control
  - Everything is free (except paying participants)
  - You learn a pretty marketable skill

## Some general advice

- These are computer *languages*, but we're not learning them like you might learn French

- Think of it more as learning to cook French:

  - You don't read an entire French cookbook
  - You pick something you *want* to make, google a recipe
  - Give it a go
  - Might not work but you can always try again (if motivated...)
  - Helps if you reflect on how you did it and how you might do it differently

- In this course, we'll be learning a few recipes and practicing them until they're good

## Some general advice

- It's not as specialised as you might think
  - I never thought of myself as a computer-y person until I had to do some coding
  - It's really just problem solving
  
- Real coders spend a lot of time:
  - Googling the error message
  - Copying and pasting other people's code from the internet
  - Figuring it out for one project and then just reusing it *forever*

## Some general advice

- Things are going to not work at first
  - need patience
  - need problem solving
  - need humility: 
    - it's a machine, it's just doing what it's told
    - either you've told it the wrong thing, or 
    - you've misunderstood how it's supposed to work

## Some general advice

- I'm going to help you and scaffold things as much as possible
- But ultimately, the best way to learn is to do and mess up

## HTML

- Hypertext Markup Language

- Content and structure of the web page & basic styling

## HTML vs WYSIWYG

This is **bold** (rendered, WYSIWYG)

`This is **bold**` (markup)

`This is <b>bold</b>` (html)

`<b>` is an HTML tag

`<b>...</b>` marks out a bit of text with this tag  

## Some HTML tags

- `p`: paragraph
- `i`: italics
- `h1`...`h6` headings
- `title`
- `body`

 &#x2192; exercise 1
 
## HTML content

Embedding an image in Word: drag, drop; use mouse/GUI to resize

`<img>` in html

But this tag needs some attributes: where to find the image file (src)? how big to make it (width, height)?

&#x2192; Google 'html img' (try the w3schools link)

&#x2192; Add an image to exercise 1 (the source is "figs/tenor.gif")

&#x2192; Try change its height

## HTML content is hierarchical

- The tag for an unordered list is `ul`
- The tag for an element in that list is `li` (list item)
- So the list itself will be `<ul>...</ul>` and inside that you'll put some `<li>...</li>` for each item

```
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

&#x2192; Try add an *ordered* list to exercise 1. 

&#x2192; Try organise it (new lines, indentations) so that it's easier to see the structure

## HTML inputs

There are `<input>` and `<button>` tags

&#x2192; Add a button saying 'click me!' to exercise 1

&#x2192; Now, make the button be filled with the nyan cat image, instead of "click me!"

## CSS

The site still looks pretty ugly

We can style it by adding a `style` attribute to tags:

`<p style="...">my paragraph is short</p>`

&#x2192; Google 'html style' to find some examples (again, the w3schools site is good). 

&#x2192; exercise 2

- Try changing: `color`, `border`, `margin`, `text-align` for the paragraphs

- Properties are separated by semi-colons: `<p style="color: red; background: black">`;

## CSS

- We don't want to have to change every paragraph if we want some consistency across paragraphs

- Can add a class attribute, so instead of just `<p>....</p>`, you can have
   - `<p class="my-class-name">...</p>`

- Then CSS can style these classes

&#x2192; exercise 3

- Look at the new `<style>` tag
- The class names are indicated with . in front (otherwise it will look for a tag with that name)
- Their style is in {} 
- Properties separated by ;
- Add a new class that includes paragraphs 1 and 3 and style their width (google `css width`)
- Classes are separated by space: `<p class="class1 class2">...</p>`

## JS

So far, everything is static: nothing changes, nothing happens when we click the button

JS is the language for making things interactive/making events occur/changing things

For this, we need a `<script>` tag

&#x2192; exercise 4

## JS functions

functions are the bits of the script that do things

```
function function_name(input){do_something; return output}
```

## JS functions

functions are the bits of the script that do things

```{js}
function function_name(input){
  do_something;
  return output
}
```

## JS functions

functions are the bits of the script that do things

```{js}
function invert(input){
  var inverse = 1/input;
  return inverse
}
```

&#x2192; add this function to the script in exercise 4

&#x2192; find the inverse of variables a, b, and c
 
## JS and events

There are certain events that commonly happen in the browser:

- key presses

- mouse clicks

- scrolling

## JS and events

To have something happen, you need to specify 3 things

- what should happen
  - a function
- when it should happen
  - when clicked, when key pressed, when scrolling, after 10 seconds, on loading, etc.
- what document element is should happen for
  - e.g., you might something to happen if anywhere on the whole document is clicked, or just if a button is clicked
  
&#x2192; exercise 5

- copy/tweak the existing model (which has something happen when the whole document is clicked) to have something happen when the button is clicked

- to do this, you need to have JS 'grab' the button:
    - To make the button identifiable, we give it an `id` attribute
    - We then put it inside: `document.getElementById("...")`

## Homework

- Readings
   - What do these tell you about x-phi or what perspective do these give you that we didn't cover?

- Coding
   1. try turn the document `example.pdf` into an html page (approximating the styling). The raw text is in homework_1.html. 
   2. make a button do something different on odd and even clicks (homework_2.html)
   3. make a number guessing game (homework_3.html)
