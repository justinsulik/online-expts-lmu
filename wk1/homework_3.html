      <p>
        I am thinking of a random number between 0 and 100. Try to guess it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="guess">Your guess:</label>
        <input type="text" id="guess-input" name="guess" size="3">
        <button id="submit">
          Submit
        </button>
  </body>

    // Instructions:
    // Think of what problem(s) your're trying to solve, and what steps those involve
    // At a minimum, you'll need:
    // A way to generate a random number
    // A click event attached to the submit button
    // A function that runs (when the button is clicked) that does something with the input
    // Some feedback to the player (are they correct? what other info might they need?)

    // Once you have a basic demo working, try make it better, adding in new features
    // What happens once the player has guessed right?
    // What happens if the player enters a number that isn't between 0 and 100? Or something that isn't even a number?
    // It can be tedious to type and then mouse. Can you "submit" if they hit the enter key, as well as if they click the button?
