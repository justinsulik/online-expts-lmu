    // Instructions: make the button do something different on odd and even clicks

    // Think about the problem: what needs to happen? What steps? Which order to tackle them?

    // At a minimum, you'll need:
    // some way to *track* whether the current click is odd or even (so, a variable)
    // some way to *check* if the current click is odd or even (so, an "if" statement -- google "javascript if")
    // and idea of what you want to happen on each click (a function)
    // a way to attach those events to the button when clicked

    // what do you want to do?
    function do_something(click_event){
      click_event.target.style.backgroundColor = "red"
    }

    // what element will do something?
    var button = document.getElementById("my-button")

    // when will it do something? On clicking...
    button.onclick = function(event){
      do_something(event)
    }
